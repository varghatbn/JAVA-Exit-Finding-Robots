# JAVA-Exit-Finding-Robots
      The project was implemented using Java as the base language. The goal of the program is
for the robots to find an exit given different scenarios. With Java being an object oriented
program, we designed each part of the program to run based on our main objects, the
robot and the exit. The map/circle and the menu are part of the main class. Through the
main menu, the user can choose between six options to demonstrate how the robots
find their way: 3 for each given scenario and 3 multi-runs to calculate the worst case and
average evacuation time.
